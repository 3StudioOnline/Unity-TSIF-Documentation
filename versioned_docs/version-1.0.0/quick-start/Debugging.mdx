## Debug IPFS Network Communication

Sometimes it is helpful being able to take a look at the data sent and received through Http requests to IPFS network.
This debugging feature can be enabled by calling:

```cs
Ipfs.SetDebugLogEnabled(
    bool enabled,
    Ipfs.DebugMode debugMode)
```

You can select what is the data you want to be printed in the log when sending requests to IPFS, such as:

 * `Ipfs.DebugMode.DownloadFileOrGetData` enables debug logging for IPFS Download File or Get Data functions.
 * `Ipfs.DebugMode.UploadFileOrData` enables debug logging for IPFS Upload File or Data functions.

This will help you visualize the data in the *requests* sent to `IPFS` network and the *responses* that you will get
back from it. Also, all errors will be logged if something wrong happened during the process.
