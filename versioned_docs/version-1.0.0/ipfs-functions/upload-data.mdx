## Upload Data Function (Task)

```cs
Task<> IPFS.IpfsFunctionLibrary.UploadData(
    IpfsPinningServiceConfig ipfsPinningServiceConfig,
    string bearerToken,
    string dataToUpload,
    string saveAs)
```

This function uploads data to the *IPFS* network. This function requires inputs as follows:

* `ipfsPinningServiceConfig`: Holds the URL and name of the pinning service to send the request to.
* `bearerToken`: The API token for authentication.
* `dataToUpload`: The path of the file to upload.
* `saveAs`: Optional alternate filename for the uploaded file on IPFS.

The returned *Response* is a `Task` that holds data such as headers, status code, and body of the response of the HTTP
request.

```cs
Task<(bool success, string errorMessage, HttpResponse response, string cid)>
```

:::info
If `success` is `true` that only means the upload to the *IPFS* network was successful.

:::

If successful, returns the `cid` of the uploaded data in *string* format.



## Upload Data Function (Delegate)

```cs
void IPFS.IpfsFunctionLibrary.UploadData(
    IpfsPinningServiceConfig ipfsPinningServiceConfig,
    string bearerToken,
    string dataToUpload,
    string saveAs,
    IpfsUploadDataDelegate responseDelegate)
```

This is a wrapper function for the async implementation. It exists to provide
the same functionality but using a delegate for handling responses.

```cs
delegate void IpfsUploadDataDelegate(
    bool success,
    string errorMessage,
    HttpResponse response,
    string cid)
```
