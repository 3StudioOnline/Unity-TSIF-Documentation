## Get Data As Image Function (Task)

```cs
void IPFS.IpfsFunctionLibrary.GetDataAsImage(
    IpfsHttpGatewayConfig ipfsHttpGatewayConfig,
    IpfsAddress ipfsAddress)
```

This function gets data as image from the *IPFS* network for the specified CID/Path. This function requires
inputs as follows:

* `ipfsHttpGatewayConfig`: Holds the URL of the gateway to send the request to.
* `ipfsAddress`: Holds the CID and path of the file on *IPFS* network.

The returned *Response* is a `Task` that holds data such as headers, status code, and body of the response of the HTTP
request.

```cs
Task<(bool success, string errorMessage, HttpResponse response, Texture2D texture)>
```

:::info
If `success` is `true` that only means that the response from the *IPFS* network was successful only.
:::

If successful, returns the `texture` as *Texture 2D* object reference.



## Get Data As Image Function (Delegate)

```cs
void IPFS.IpfsFunctionLibrary.GetDataAsImage(
    IpfsHttpGatewayConfig ipfsHttpGatewayConfig,
    IpfsAddress ipfsAddress,
    IpfsGetDataAsImageDelegate responseDelegate)
```

This is a wrapper function for the async implementation. It exists to provide
the same functionality but using a delegate for handling responses.

```cs
delegate void IpfsGetDataAsImageDelegate(
    bool success,
    string errorMessage,
    HttpResponse response,
    Texture2D texture)
```
